# calc
This project implements a calculator using a Finite State Machine (FSM) in C. The calculator is capable of performing basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It supports handling of operations with respect to operator precedence and parentheses, allowing for the evaluation of complex expressions.

# Technical Details:

Language: C
Data Structures: Stacks (for managing operands and operators)
Libraries Used: Standard C libraries for string handling (<string.h>), memory management (<stdlib.h>), and assertions (<assert.h>).
Modular Design: The code is organized into functions that handle specific tasks such as operand processing, operator processing, and error handling.
